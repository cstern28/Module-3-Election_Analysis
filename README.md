# Module-3-Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes case.
2. Get a complete list of canddates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Date Source: election_results.csv
- Softwarre: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
  - Diana DeGette

## Challenge Overview
The election was not a close race and Diana exceeded her competitor votes by a large amount.

## Challenge Summary
The election analysis helped me understand Python coding better. For example, I learned that in "if" statements, the i in if cannot be capitalized. The white space matters and if the indentation is not accurately formatted, then the code will not run. Also, it's important to remember whether in a for loop or not when you add an if statement and a print. Sometimes, it would make sense to put outside the for loop depending on the situation.
